        <p>I learnt that React is powerful tool created by facebook to enable developers to create a portable User Interface. React will figure out what needs to be updated and it will do it automatically for us. So we need not worry about state management
            anymore. In traditional SPA, single page applications, the DOM manipulation is time consuming which needs a lot of effort to change the DOM or update the DOM. Therefore, we need React to provide a virtual DOM with which we work and React internally
            will take care of manipulating the original DOM as required and it will make the minimum changes that are required to keep the UI in sync with the changes.
